                    As the aim of the committee of UNWOMEN, the esteemed
                    delegates will be bringing the economic empowerment of
                    women’s to the table. They will discuss about women’s place
                    in the men dominated business and their financial rights. As
                    a result of this committee we will be expecting to find a
                    solution to help women advancing in their business career.
